# SQL Case Studies

This repository contains a collection of SQL exercises and case studies.

Each folder includes a set of queries and small analyses designed to practice:

- data manipulation  
- KPI creation  
- exploratory analysis  
- solving diverse business questions using SQL  

The goal is to provide a simple, organized overview of SQL work without going into project-specific details.
